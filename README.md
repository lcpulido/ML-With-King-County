# Regression-With-King-County
Machine learning with the King County housing data. The dataset contained various information on houses in King County. I wanted to see if I could create some models that will be useful in predicting the prices of houses around the area. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. I only used regression algorithms since I wanted to predict a numeric predictor “price” which I felt would be most useful. To help prevent academic dishonesty some of the code was redacted. It can be provided upon request to recruiters or potential employers. 

Algorithms used were: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Network, and kNN. 

This was written in R using R studio.
