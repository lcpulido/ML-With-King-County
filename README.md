# ML-With-King-County
Machine learning with the King County housing data. The dataset contained various information on houses in King County. I wanted to see if I could create some models that will be useful in predicting the prices of houses around the area. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. I mainly used regression algorithms since I wanted to predict a numeric predictor “price” which I felt would be most useful. To help prevent academic dishonesty code and certain information was redacted. The original project can be provided upon request to recruiters or potential employers. 

Algorithms used were: Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Neural Network, and kNN. 

Accuracies from algorithms: 

Linear Regression had 81.86% 
Neural Network for Regression had 76.08% 
kNN for Regression had 73.25% 
Decision tree $78,482.55 off 

MSE from algorithms: 

45,493,137,091  lm1
42,302,624,392  lm2
58,433,075,757 decision tree
6,128,176,116  random forest
